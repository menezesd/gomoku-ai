Usage

Run the game by executing the runGomoku.py script with the following command-line arguments:


python runGomoku.py <board size> <search depth> <player (1 or 2)>

    <board size>: The size of the game board (e.g., 15 for a 15x15 board).
    <search depth>: The depth to which the Minimax algorithm should search for the best move.
    <player>: Indicates whether the human player is player 1 or player 2 (1 for player 1, 2 for player 2).

Gameplay

    Upon running the script, the Gomoku game window will appear.
    The game board is displayed, and the AI will make its move based on the specified depth of search.
    You, as the human player, will then make your move by clicking on an empty cell on the board.
    The game alternates between human and AI turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
